## How to contribute

You can add a translation for your own language. Just [fork this repository](https://github.com/ASchmidt1024/monero-for-merchants-booklet/fork), add a new file in folder `translations`, e.g. spanish.md, and create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request?tool=webui).

The pull request of a translation should be proofread by a native speaker. Once it has been passed, I will take the opportunity to translate it and make the booklet available in the language as a PDF.

Found a spelling or other mistake? Feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/ASchmidt1024/monero-for-merchants-booklet/issues/new/choose) for it. Thank you.
